Note to Shaista: On this particular style of ring, because there are two colors (yellow gold and white gold)
 when rhodium plating we don't want to rhodium plate the whole ring, it would make the yellow gold parst white.
 So we need to mask, or paint over the yellow gold to keep it from plating.so on all 6 "Two Tone bands"
